Both of us have contributed equally to this assignment.
We tried our best to distribute and complete the assigned task.

We have used some online resources like the 
1) AVR instruction set manual : 
 [https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-0856-avr-instruction-set-manual.pdf]
2) Atmega328P datasheet : 
[https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf]
The next resource for making drawings for the schematic
3) Wondershare Edraw software (for drawing block diagrams) : 
[https://www.edrawsoft.com/ad/edrawmax-diagram-tool.html?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9NwhTOfxdJqbuieY49dca-WLbFO1p0f72tXsRzYU55TUd3It_PkgLKhoCsqsQAvD_BwE]

For improving our designs and for clearing few doubts in implementing some of the programs, we have discussed with
